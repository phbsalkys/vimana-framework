    description: |
      Django offers a set of function decorators to help you
      control which information should be filtered out of error
      reports in a production environment (that is, where DEBUG is
      set to False): sensitive_variables() and
      sensitive_post_parameters().

      * sensitive_variables

      If a function (either a view or any regular callback) in
      your code uses local variables susceptible to contain
      sensitive information, you may prevent the values of those
      variables from being included in error reports using the
      sensitive_variables decorator.
        
      To systematically hide all local variables of a function
      from error logs, do not provide any argument to the
      sensitive_variables decorator: sensitive_variables()
       
      * sensitive_post_parameters

      If one of your views receives an HttpRequest object with
      POST parameters susceptible to contain sensitive
      information, you may prevent the values of those parameters
      from being included in the error reports using the
      sensitive_post_parameters decorator.
