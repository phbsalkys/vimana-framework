description: |
  This tool was designed to passively identify the Python
  framework version, acquiring and analyzing standard
  files from framework installations. This first version
  only supports Django, but it'll soon be compatible with
  Flask. It can be invoked directly from the command line
  through the command and incorporated by other tools
  such as DMT, which gathers it in the initial stages of
  the analysis.
