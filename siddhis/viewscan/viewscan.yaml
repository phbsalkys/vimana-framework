description: |
  ViewScan is a tool for identifying potential security
  issues in Django views. It analyzes the view functions
  in Django applications and checks for common issues
  related to authentication, authorization, and sensitive
  data filtering.

  While ViewScan does not aim to be a generic scanner
  for Python applications, it provides a useful tool
  for identifying potential security risks in Django
  views. Its pattern matching engine can detect issues
  related to authentication and authorization, sensitive
  data filtering, and other categories of issues that
  may be added in future versions.

  Overall, ViewScan is a valuable tool for Django
  developers who want to enhance the security of their
  applications. By using ViewScan to identify potential
  security risks, developers can ensure that their
  applications are less vulnerable to attacks and better
  protected against security breaches.
