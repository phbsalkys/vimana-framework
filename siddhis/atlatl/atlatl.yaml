description: |
  This module is intended to act as a specific listener
  to capture and authenticate Flask debug console sessions
  and also act as a stable communication channel with the
  affected server. In this first version atlatl works in
  conjunction with the flask_pinstealer payload, but new
  possibilities are on the way.
