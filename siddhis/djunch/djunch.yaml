description: |
  Djunch is a Django application fuzzer whose purpose is
  to spot unhandled exceptions and feed the caller modules
  with a variety of data, such as:

     * Application and server environment variables 
     * Traceback/stacktrace breakpoints 
     * Categorized keywords 
     * Source code snippets  
     * Software versions 
     * Django objects

  Djunch is usually called by other modules receiving its
  input and returning the fuzzer result as an enrichment
  that can be used to take the subsequent actions.
