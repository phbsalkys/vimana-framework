  Simple utility to retrieve CVE ids from the official
  Django security releases page. This module receives a
  Django version as an argument and retrieves related CVE
  ids. Prana is usually used as a resource by other Vimana
  modules. For example, DMT (Django Misconfiguration
  Tracker) uses to correlate the identified framework
  version (context 'environment') with the respective CVES.
